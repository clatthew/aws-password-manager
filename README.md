# Password manager
Manage credentials stored in AWS SecretsManager. All credentials used by PasswordManager will be stored in the /password_manager directory of your SecretsManager. Runs in a mocked AWS environment by default.

## Setup
In terminal, run
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pytest --testdox`

then run password_manager.py in the virtual environment.

## Funtionallity
### Authentication
Upon startup, PasswordManager will ask for your master credentials. Enter your username and password to enter the program.

4. Press "x" to exit entry mode without saving.
### Retrieval
Enter the name of the credential you would like to retrieve.
If the credential exists, its fields will be echoed to the terminal and you will be returned to the main menu.
If the credential doesn't exist, you will be returned to the main menu.
